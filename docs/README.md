## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture
ComplianceFlow serves multiple customer organizations (tenants) from a single platform instance. See `Roles_and_Personas.md` for the critical distinction between:
- **Platform Roles** - Our company staff (Platform Admin, Platform Support)
- **Tenant Roles** - Customer organization users (Tenant Admin, Compliance Officer, Reviewer, User)

### Event-Driven Architecture
Services communicate asynchronously via Kafka/Azure Event Hubs. See event schemas in each service PRD.

### AI-Assisted Development
This project demonstrates AI integration throughout the entire SDLC. See `AI_Assisted_Development_Workflow.md` and `Business_Value_Proposition.md`.
