## 1. Executive Summary

The Compliance Flow Application is a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to automate and streamline declaration processes, initially focused on financial services compliance (personal trades, gifts/entertainment, holdings attestations) but built as a generic declaration platform. The system enables users to submit activity declarations through dynamic forms, automates evaluation through configurable rules, and manages review workflows with business unit-specific configurations.

### Key Objectives
- Provide a scalable multi-tenant SaaS platform for declaration management
- Automate declaration evaluation through configurable business rules with audit trails
- Enable business unit-specific form selection and reviewer assignment
- Support parallel review workflows with reviewer groups
- Provide comprehensive case management for compliance investigations
- Enable flexible form building and rule configuration by compliance officers
- Support break-glass processes with full audit trails

- Manage review workflows with business unit-specific configurations
- Assign reviewers through configurable groups with fallback options
- Track and investigate compliance cases with silent case creation
- Maintain comprehensive audit trails for all decisions and rule evaluations

### 2.2 Solution Overview
A multi-tenant cloud-native SaaS platform that provides:
- Self-service declaration submission with business unit-specific dynamic forms
- Automated rule-based evaluation engine with comprehensive audit trails
- Parallel review workflow management with reviewer groups
- Silent case creation alongside approval/denial decisions
- Case management and investigation tools with notes and attachments

```

### 11.2 Key Definitions

#### Silent Cases
- **Definition**: Investigation cases created automatically by rules without user visibility
- **Trigger**: Rules evaluate to "create_case" flag alongside approval/denial decision
- **Visibility**: Only visible to compliance officers, hidden from declaration submitter
- **Purpose**: Enable covert investigation of potentially suspicious activities

#### Business Unit Form Selection
- **Algorithm**: 
  1. Query forms for declaration_type where business_unit matches user.business_unit
  2. Sort by ranking (descending)
  3. Return highest ranking form
  4. If no match, return fallback form (ranking = 0, business_unit = "*")
- **Fallback**: Every declaration type must have a fallback form

#### Break-Glass Process
- **Scope**: Compliance officers can override any review decision
- **Actions**: Force approve/deny with mandatory reason
- **Audit**: All break-glass actions logged with enhanced audit trail
- **Constraints**: Cannot be used by compliance officer on their own declarations
