## Story 1: Setup Terraform Backend for State Management

**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: P0 (Must be first)

### User Story
As a **DevOps engineer**, I want **Terraform state stored securely in Azure**, so that **multiple developers can collaborate and state is protected from loss**.

### Context
Terraform requires a remote backend to store state files for collaborative infrastructure management. Azure Blob Storage provides secure, versioned storage for Terraform state with locking capabilities to prevent concurrent modifications.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Scenario 1: Azure Storage Account Created
```gherkin
Given I have an Azure subscription
When I run the backend setup script
Then an Azure Storage Account is created with appropriate naming convention
And a blob container named "tfstate" is created
And versioning is enabled on the container
And encryption at rest is enabled
```

#### Scenario 2: Terraform Backend Configuration
```gherkin
Given the Azure Storage Account exists
When I initialize Terraform with backend configuration
Then Terraform successfully connects to the remote backend
And the state file is stored in Azure Blob Storage
And state locking is enabled via Azure Blob lease
```

#### Scenario 3: Access Control Configured
```gherkin
Given the Terraform backend is configured
When multiple developers attempt to apply changes
Then only one developer can hold the state lock at a time
And appropriate RBAC permissions are set on the storage account
And service principal has necessary permissions
```

### Technical Implementation Notes

* **Files**: 
  * `infrastructure/backend.tf`
  * `infrastructure/backend-setup.sh` (or .ps1 for Windows)
  * `infrastructure/README.md`
* **Azure Resources**:
  * Storage Account: `stcomplianceflowterraform<env>`
  * Container: `tfstate`
  * Resource Group: `rg-complianceflow-terraform`

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "rg-complianceflow-terraform"
    storage_account_name = "stcomplianceflowterraform"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "complianceflow.tfstate"
  }
}
```

### Definition of Done
* [ ] Azure Storage Account created for Terraform state
* [ ] Blob container with versioning enabled
* [ ] Backend configuration file created
* [ ] Terraform initializes successfully with remote backend
* [ ] State locking works (tested with concurrent operations)

**Priority**: P0 (Blocks all services)

### User Story
As a **DevOps engineer**, I want **network infrastructure defined in Terraform**, so that **all microservices can communicate securely within isolated networks**.

### Context
Azure Virtual Network provides network isolation for the ComplianceFlow platform. We need subnets for different tiers (database, application, management) with Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control traffic flow.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Scenario 1: Virtual Network Created
```gherkin
Given Terraform is initialized with the backend
When I apply the networking module
Then a Virtual Network is created with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
And the VNet is created in the appropriate Azure region
And the VNet is tagged with project and environment information
```

#### Scenario 2: Subnets Configured
```gherkin
Given the Virtual Network exists
When the networking module is applied
Then a database subnet (10.0.1.0/24) is created
And an application subnet (10.0.2.0/24) is created
And a management subnet (10.0.3.0/24) is created
And each subnet is associated with appropriate NSGs
```

#### Scenario 3: Network Security Groups Applied
```gherkin
Given subnets are created
When NSG rules are applied
Then database subnet only allows traffic from application subnet on PostgreSQL port (5432)
And application subnet allows inbound HTTPS traffic (443) from internet
And management subnet only allows SSH/RDP from specific IP ranges
And all outbound traffic to internet is allowed for updates
```

#### Scenario 4: Private Endpoints Support
```gherkin
Given the networking infrastructure exists
When services require private connectivity
Then subnet delegation is configured for Azure Database for PostgreSQL
And service endpoints are enabled for Azure Storage and Key Vault
```

When the CI workflow runs
Then code is checked out successfully
And linting runs (flake8, black, mypy for Python)
And unit tests run with coverage reporting
And coverage report is uploaded to Codecov
And workflow fails if tests fail or coverage drops below 80%
```

#### Scenario 3: Docker Image Build
```gherkin

1. **Story 1**: Terraform Backend (prerequisite for all)
2. **Story 2**: Networking Module (prerequisite for all resources)
3. **Stories 3-7**: Can be worked in parallel (Database, Redis, Event Hubs, Key Vault, Monitoring)
4. **Story 8**: Docker Compose (parallel with Terraform work)
5. **Story 9**: GitHub Actions (parallel with Terraform work)
6. **Story 10**: Deploy to Azure (after stories 1-7 complete)
7. **Story 11**: Documentation (ongoing throughout sprint)

### Critical Path
Story 1 → Story 2 → Stories 3-6 → Story 10

### Risk Items
* Azure quota limits
* Service principal permission issues
* Terraform state locking conflicts
* Event Hub throughput settings

### Success Criteria
* Development environment fully operational in Azure
* Local development environment functional
* CI/CD pipelines running
* All documentation complete
* Ready to begin ECS-8 (User Service)
