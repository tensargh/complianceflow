## üèóÔ∏è Microservices Architecture

### Identified Services (8 Total)

| Service | Domain | Primary Responsibility |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| **User Service** | Identity & Access | SSO, users, business units, role mapping |
| **Declaration Service** | Declaration Management | CRUD, submissions, file handling, status |
| **Form Service** | Form Management | Form builder, versioning, selection logic |
| **Rule Engine Service** | Decision Automation | Rule evaluation, decisions, silent cases |
| **Review Service** | Review Workflow | Reviewer groups, assignments, escalations |
| **Case Service** | Investigation Management | Case lifecycle, notes, findings |
| **Notification Service** | Communication | Email delivery, templates, channels |
| **Analytics Service** | Reporting & Analytics | Dashboards, metrics, exports |

### Service Communication Pattern
```
Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core Events: declaration.*, review.*, case.*, user.*
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service-to-Service: REST APIs for synchronous operations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ External Integration: Azure services, SSO providers
```

## üìà Business Value

### Microservices Benefits
- **Independent Deployment**: Each service can be deployed independently
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use optimal technologies
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work on services independently
- **Scalability**: Services can scale based on individual demands
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade

### Development Benefits
- **Clear Ownership**: Each service has defined responsibilities
- **Testability**: Services can be tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused codebases
- **Documentation**: Complete PRD for each service
- **Cursor Compatibility**: Each PRD optimized for AI-assisted development

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review Individual PRDs**: Validate each service PRD meets your requirements
2. **Technology Setup**: Confirm technology stack choices align with preferences
3. **Development Environment**: Set up Docker Compose for local development
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Plan Azure DevOps pipeline structure

### Development Planning
1. **Sprint Planning**: Break each service into user stories
2. **API-First Development**: Define OpenAPI specs before implementation
3. **Database Design**: Create detailed database schemas
4. **Event Schema Registry**: Set up Kafka schema registry
5. **Testing Strategy**: Plan unit, integration, and end-to-end testing

### Success Criteria
- Each service can be developed by separate Cursor instances
- Services integrate seamlessly via defined APIs and events
- Platform scales to handle enterprise workloads
- Comprehensive audit and compliance capabilities
