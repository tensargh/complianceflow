## 📊 Detailed Comparison

### Project Management: Jira vs Azure DevOps

| Feature | Jira Free | Azure DevOps Free | Winner |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Users** | 10 | 5 | ✅ Jira |
| **Boards** | Scrum/Kanban | Yes | Tie |
| **Automation** | 100 runs/month | Limited | ✅ Jira |
| **MCP Support** | Good (community) | Poor (none) | ✅ Jira |
| **Market Adoption** | Very High | High (MS shops) | ✅ Jira |
| **Storage** | 2 GB | 1 GB Git LFS | ✅ Jira |

### Source Control: GitHub (Clear Winner)

**Why GitHub?**
1. ✅ **MCP Support** - Official MCP from Anthropic (best integration)
2. ✅ **Free Tier** - Unlimited repos, unlimited collaborators
3. ✅ **Industry Standard** - Most widely used (great for consulting proof)
4. ✅ **Actions Integration** - Seamless CI/CD
5. ✅ **Community** - Largest developer community
6. ✅ **Features** - Issues, PRs, Projects, Discussions all free

**Alternatives:**
- GitLab: Good, but less MCP support
- Azure Repos: Only if using full ADO stack
- Bitbucket: Less popular, tied to Atlassian

---

### CI/CD: GitHub Actions (Clear Winner)

**Why GitHub Actions?**
1. ✅ **Free Tier** - 2,000 minutes/month for private repos
2. ✅ **Public Repos** - **UNLIMITED minutes** (perfect for demos!)
3. ✅ **Integration** - Native GitHub integration
4. ✅ **Marketplace** - Huge action library
5. ✅ **Multi-platform** - Linux, Windows, macOS runners

**💡 Pro Tip for Your Use Case:**
Make your demo repositories PUBLIC:
- Unlimited CI/CD minutes
- Great for consulting portfolio
- Shows transparency and expertise
- No cost concerns as you scale

**Alternatives:**
- Azure Pipelines: 1,800 min/month (less than GitHub)
- GitLab CI: Good but less integration options
- CircleCI: Limited free tier

      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What You Can Do:**
- Create/update issues from Cursor
- Manage PRs and reviews
- Search code and issues
- Create branches
- Read file contents
- Get repository information

**Use Cases in Your Workflow:**
1. PO creates GitHub issues from Cursor after refining features
2. Developers pull issue details when starting work
3. Auto-link PRs to issues
4. Update issue status from development environment

---

### Jira MCP (Community)
**Available Options:**
1. `mcp-jira` - Community package
2. Custom MCP using Jira REST API
3. Various npm packages (research needed)

**What You Can Do:**
- Create/update Jira issues
- Query using JQL
- Transition issues through workflow
- Add comments and attachments
- Link issues

**Use Cases in Your Workflow:**
1. PO creates stories in Jira from Cursor
2. Tech leads pull stories and create sub-tasks
3. Developers update story status
4. Automated status updates from CI/CD

**Setup Considerations:**
- Jira Cloud API token required
- May need to evaluate different community MCPs
- Consider building custom MCP if needed (great consulting demo!)

## 💰 Cost Analysis (Monthly)

### Scenario 1: Solo (You Only)
```
Jira:            $0 (1 user, well under 10 limit)
GitHub:          $0 (unlimited free)
GitHub Actions:  $0 (use public repos = unlimited)
Cursor:          $20/month (Pro plan)
---------
TOTAL:           $20/month
```

### Scenario 2: Small Team (5 people)
```
Jira:            $0 (5 users, under 10 limit)
GitHub:          $0 (unlimited free)
GitHub Actions:  $0 (use public repos = unlimited)
Cursor:          $100/month ($20 x 5)
---------
TOTAL:           $100/month
```

### Scenario 3: Growing (10 people)
```
Jira:            $0 (10 users, at free limit)
GitHub:          $0 (unlimited free)
GitHub Actions:  $0 (use public repos = unlimited)
Cursor:          $200/month ($20 x 10)
---------
TOTAL:           $200/month
```

### When You'll Need to Pay
**Jira:**
- 11th user added
- Need advanced permissions/audit logs
- Want more automation runs

**GitHub:**
- Need advanced security features (SAML, etc.)
- Exceed 2,000 Actions minutes/month on private repos
- Need GitHub Advanced Security

**Recommendation:** Stay on free tiers as long as possible. When demonstrating to clients, the fact that you built this entirely on free tiers is a SELLING POINT!

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### API Tokens
```
✅ DO:
- Use personal access tokens (PATs)
- Set minimal required permissions
- Store in environment variables
- Rotate regularly
- Use different tokens for different purposes

❌ DON'T:
- Commit tokens to repositories
- Use the same token everywhere
- Grant full access when limited scope works
- Share tokens between team members
```

### Public Repository Considerations
```
✅ SAFE to Make Public:
- Application code
- Documentation
- CI/CD workflows
- Tests
- Configuration templates

❌ KEEP PRIVATE:
- API keys and secrets
- Customer data
- Production configurations
- Internal business logic (if sensitive)
```

**For ComplianceFlow:**
- Make repos PUBLIC to get unlimited Actions
- Use GitHub Secrets for any sensitive config
- Document security practices (great consulting content!)
