## Context: How We Got Here

### The PRD Foundation (Pre-Epic Work)

**Before breaking down epics into stories**, significant requirements work was completed using AI assistance:

#### Greenfield Project Approach
ComplianceFlow is a **new project built from scratch**. The Product Owner used AI to:

1. **Brainstorm and Refine Product Vision** (2-3 hours with AI vs. 1-2 weeks traditional)
   - Discussed business needs conversationally with AI
   - AI helped identify edge cases and requirements gaps
   - Refined scope through iterative conversation

2. **Create Main PRD** (`PRD_ComplianceFlow.md`)
   - 450+ lines of comprehensive requirements
   - 8 microservices identified
   - Event-driven architecture defined
   - Data models and service boundaries documented
   - **Time:** ~3-4 hours with AI vs. 2-3 weeks traditional

3. **Create Individual Service PRDs** (8 documents)
   - Detailed API specifications
   - Entity definitions with field types
   - Event schemas
   - Security and performance requirements
   - **Time per PRD:** 30-45 minutes with AI vs. 1-2 days traditional each

**Total PRD Creation Time:**
- **With AI:** ~6-8 hours for complete requirements suite
- **Traditional:** 3-4 weeks of full-time work
- **Time Saved:** ~75-80%

#### Alternative: Adding to Existing Platform

If this were an **existing platform** rather than greenfield:
- Start with existing documentation and architectural patterns
- Review existing service templates and coding standards
- Build new PRDs based on established patterns
- Reference existing event schemas and API conventions
- Ensure consistency with current tech stack

**Key Point:** Whether greenfield or brownfield, AI accelerates the requirements phase dramatically. For existing platforms, AI helps maintain consistency with established patterns even faster.

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 0: Requirements Foundation (Pre-Epic)
**Role:** Product Owner + Stakeholders  
**Tools:** Cursor AI  
**Time Savings:** 75-80% reduction in PRD creation time

This stage is often invisible but crucial. Before epics and stories, you need comprehensive requirements documentation.

**See `Context: How We Got Here` section above for details.**

---

### Stage 1: Product Management & Requirements
**Role:** Product Owner / Product Manager  
**Tools:** Cursor AI, Jira/ADO MCP  
**Time Savings:** 40-60% reduction in story preparation time

#### The Interactive Process

**Critical Mindset:** AI is your **co-pilot, not autopilot**. The Product Owner drives the process, validates outputs, and ensures business value. AI removes toil, not thinking.

**Starting Point:** Comprehensive PRDs already exist (created with AI assistance in Stage 0)

#### Detailed Workflow

##### 1. Epic & Story Planning Session

**Before AI:**
- Manually write epic descriptions
- Spend hours formatting user stories
- Struggle to maintain consistency
- Miss acceptance criteria
- Repeat work across similar stories

**With AI (Interactive Process):**

1. **Start the Conversation** (5-10 minutes)
   ```
   You: "Let's plan the Infrastructure Setup epic for our microservices platform.
   We need Terraform modules for Azure (PostgreSQL, Redis, Event Hubs, Key Vault),
   Docker Compose for local dev, and CI/CD pipelines."
   
   AI: *Generates initial epic breakdown with 8-10 stories*
   ```

2. **Review & Refine** (10-15 minutes)
   ```
   You: "Good start. Break the PostgreSQL story down more - we need 8 separate databases
   for our services. Also add a story for monitoring infrastructure."
   
   AI: *Updates story list, adds PostgreSQL details, creates monitoring story*
   ```

3. **Add Acceptance Criteria** (15-20 minutes)
   ```
   You: "For the Terraform Backend story, ensure we cover state locking,
   versioning, and RBAC permissions."
   
   AI: *Generates Gherkin scenarios for each requirement*
   ```

4. **Validate & Create** (5-10 minutes)
   - Review all stories one final time
   - AI creates them in Jira via MCP
   - You verify they're linked correctly

**Total Time:** 35-55 minutes for 11 detailed stories  
**Traditional Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Time Saved:** ~60%

##### 2. What AI Handles (The Toil)

‚úÖ **Formatting** - Converts your thoughts into proper Gherkin syntax  
‚úÖ **Boilerplate** - Adds Definition of Done, technical notes, dependencies  
‚úÖ **Consistency** - Ensures all stories follow same template  
‚úÖ **Linking** - Creates proper parent-child relationships in Jira  
‚úÖ **Completeness** - Suggests acceptance criteria you might miss  

##### 3. What YOU Handle (The Thinking)

üß† **Business Value** - What problem does this solve?  
üß† **Priority** - What order should these be implemented?  
üß† **Scope** - Is this story too big? Too small?  
üß† **Validation** - Do these acceptance criteria actually test the requirement?  
üß† **Dependencies** - What blockers exist? What sequence makes sense?  

##### 4. Iterative Refinement Example

**Initial Epic Breakdown:**
```
Epic: ECS-7 Infrastructure Setup
- Story 1: Setup Terraform
- Story 2: Create networking
- Story 3: Setup databases
```

**After PO Review:**
```
You: "Story 3 is too broad. We have 8 different databases, each needs
proper isolation, backup config, and connection strings in Key Vault."

AI: *Expands into detailed story with 4 scenarios covering server setup,
individual databases, backups, and performance configuration*
```

**After Second Review:**
```
You: "Good, but add a specific list of all 8 database names following
our naming convention."

AI: *Adds technical notes section listing all databases with proper naming*
```

This is **interactive refinement** - AI does heavy lifting, you steer direction.

##### 5. Documentation Generation

**Process:**
1. **Epic Description** (AI-generated, PO-reviewed)
   - Purpose and scope
   - Key deliverables
   - Success criteria
   - Dependencies

2. **User Stories** (AI-generated from conversations)
   - Gherkin acceptance criteria
   - Technical implementation notes
   - Definition of Done checklist
   - Story point estimates

3. **Implementation Sequence Document** (AI-generated from dependencies)
   - Dependency graph
   - Critical path analysis
   - Parallelization opportunities
   - Risk mitigation

**The PO's Role:**
- Provide high-level requirements and context
- Validate AI output for business accuracy
- Refine stories based on team capacity
- Ensure stories deliver actual value

##### 6. Real Example: ECS-7 Breakdown

**PO Input (5 minutes):**
"We need infrastructure for 8 microservices: User, Declaration, Form, Rule Engine, Review, Case, Notification, Analytics. Use Terraform for Azure. Include PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka/Event Hubs, Key Vault, monitoring. Also need Docker Compose for local dev and CI/CD pipelines."

**AI Output (30 seconds):**
- 11 detailed stories
- 65 story points estimated
- Full Gherkin acceptance criteria
- Technical implementation notes
- Dependency mapping
- Risk items identified

**PO Refinement (20 minutes):**
- Adjusted story sequences
- Added specific Azure SKU requirements
- Clarified monitoring alert thresholds
- Validated deferred tasks (path filters)
- Approved for sprint planning

**Total: 25 minutes for sprint-ready backlog**

##### 7. Key Benefits for Product Owners

**Speed:**
- 40-60% faster story creation
- Consistent quality across all stories
- Reduced sprint planning meeting time

**Quality:**
