- Comprehensive automated testing
- Security scanning tools
- Never auto-merge AI agent PRs without review

### Tool Lock-in
**Risk:** Heavy dependency on specific AI tools  
**Mitigation:**
- Use standard languages and frameworks
- Document patterns independently of tools
- Maintain ability to work without AI
- Regular evaluation of tool alternatives

### Data Privacy & IP
**Risk:** Sensitive code sent to AI services  
**Mitigation:**
- Use enterprise AI services with data privacy
- Review terms of service carefully
- Implement code scanning for secrets
- Consider self-hosted AI models for sensitive code

### Change Management
**Risk:** Team resistance to new workflow  
**Mitigation:**
- Gradual rollout with pilot teams
