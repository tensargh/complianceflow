## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished Today

### Phase 0: Requirements Foundation
- Created comprehensive PRDs (main + 8 services)
- Established roles and personas (platform vs tenant)
- Set up documentation structure
- **Time:** ~6-8 hours with AI vs 3-4 weeks traditional

### Phase 1: Product Management - Story Creation

- **Time Savings:** 86%

### Phase 1b: Story Review & Validation
- Identified platform vs tenant role confusion
- Corrected 6 stories in Jira
- Created Roles_and_Personas.md
- Updated PRDs with correct role model
- **Time:** 15 minutes (in progress)

---

## üîÑ Current Status: Story Validation In Progress

### What's Left to Do
**Task:** Complete detailed validation of all 27 stories  
**Time Remaining:** 20-30 minutes  
**Status:** 6 of 27 stories validated and corrected

### Stories Already Reviewed
‚úÖ **ECS-29** - Database models (corrected with platform roles)  
‚úÖ **ECS-34** - JWT key rotation (Platform Admin)  
‚úÖ **ECS-35** - User CRUD (Tenant Admin)  
‚úÖ **ECS-36** - User status (Tenant Admin)  
‚úÖ **ECS-38** - Tenant management (Platform Support)  
‚úÖ **ECS-40** - SSO config (Tenant Admin)

### Stories Still Need Review
‚è≥ **ECS-18 through ECS-28** - Infrastructure stories (11 stories)  
‚è≥ **ECS-30, 31, 32, 33** - FastAPI, Alembic, JWT, SSO flow (4 stories)  
‚è≥ **ECS-37, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44** - Provisioning, business units, authz, events, testing, docs (6 stories)

---

## üéØ How to Resume Work

### Step 1: Load Context (2 minutes)
```
1. Open Cursor
2. Load docs/chatmodes/ProductOwner.md (Product Owner mode)
3. Read this file (Next_Session_Guide.md)
4. Check docs/Time_Savings_Log.md for current metrics
```

### Step 2: Continue Story Validation (20-30 minutes)

**For Each Remaining Story, Ask:**

1. **Role Check:**
   - Is the persona appropriate for this action?
   - Platform role vs Tenant role correct?
   - Can this role realistically perform this task?

2. **Business Value:**
   - Does this story deliver value?
   - Is the user story format clear (As a X, I want Y, so that Z)?
   - Is the benefit realistic?

3. **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Are Gherkin scenarios testable?
   - Do they cover happy path + edge cases?
   - Are they specific enough for developers?
   - Any missing scenarios?

4. **Technical Feasibility:**
   - Are technical notes accurate?
   - Do technologies/libraries make sense?
   - Any license compliance issues?
   - Dependencies correctly identified?

5. **Definition of Done:**
   - Is it comprehensive?
   - Are all deliverables listed?
   - Any missing testing requirements?

**Use Cursor Interactively:**
```
You: "Let's review ECS-18. Does the Terraform backend story look correct?
Check for business value, acceptance criteria completeness, and technical accuracy."

AI: *Reviews story, identifies any issues, suggests corrections*

You: *Validate AI's findings, approve or refine corrections*
```

### Step 3: Update Documentation (5 minutes)

After validation is complete:

1. **Update Time_Savings_Log.md:**
   - Add review/validation time to Entry #002
   - Calculate total time for ECS-8 (including validation)
   - Update ROI calculations

2. **Update Business_Value_Proposition.md:**
   - Note that validation phase is complete
   - Emphasize importance of human review
   - Update "Last Phase Completed"

3. **Update TASKLIST.md:**
   - Mark story validation as complete
   - Update next actions

---

## üé¨ After Story Validation Complete

### Option A: Continue as Tech Lead (Recommended)
**Next:** Create architecture diagrams for ECS-7 and ECS-8
- Network topology diagrams
- System architecture diagrams
- Sequence diagrams for authentication flow
- Database schema diagrams
- **Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes with AI vs 2-3 hours traditional
- **Demonstrates:** Tech Lead role AI benefits

### Option B: Break Down More Epics as PO
**Next:** Break down ECS-10 (Form Service)
- Shows repeatability of PO process
- Builds more backlog depth
- **Estimated Time:** 30-35 minutes (getting faster!)

### Option C: Start Development
**Next:** Implement ECS-18 (Terraform Backend)
- Shows developer role with AI assistance
- Creates actual infrastructure
- **Estimated Time:** TBD (will measure and compare)

**Recommendation:** Option A (Tech Lead) to show next SDLC phase while stories are fresh.

## üéì Key Learnings to Document

1. **AI is Fast but Not Perfect**
   - Generated 16 stories in 30 seconds
   - But missed nuanced role distinctions
   - Human review caught 5 role errors

2. **Domain Knowledge is Critical**
   - AI doesn't understand your business model
   - Platform vs Tenant distinction required human insight
   - Review phase is NOT optional

3. **Interactive Process Works**
   - AI generates, human validates, corrections made
   - 15 minutes of review prevents hours of rework
   - The collaboration is the value

4. **Documentation Quality Improved**
   - Role model now clearly documented
   - PRDs updated with corrections
   - Future epics will benefit from this learning

## üìù Notes for Next Session

### Things to Remember
- Roles_and_Personas.md is now the authoritative reference
- Platform roles (tenant_id = null): platform_admin, platform_support, platform_devops
- Tenant roles (tenant_id = specific): tenant_admin, compliance_officer, reviewer, user
- Compliance Officer ‚â† System Admin (they manage compliance PROGRAMS, not users/SSO)

### Questions to Consider
- Should we create a Tenant Admin story for initial setup workflow?
- Do we need platform admin UI stories?
- How do platform roles authenticate (not via tenant SSO)?

### Future Epic Considerations
- Other epics may have similar role confusion
- Always validate who realistically performs each action
- Reference Roles_and_Personas.md when creating stories
