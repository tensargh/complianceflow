# Next Session Quick Start Guide

**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Product Management - Story Validation (In Progress)  
**Session Status:** 2 of 28 stories validated ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ Where We Left Off

### Completed This Session
- ‚úÖ Created 27 user stories for ECS-7 (Infrastructure) and ECS-8 (User Service)
- ‚úÖ Published all stories to Jira (ECS-18 through ECS-44)
- ‚úÖ **CRITICAL**: Discovered missing Story 0 and created ECS-46
- ‚úÖ Fixed ECS-18 dependencies to reference ECS-46
- ‚úÖ Validated and approved ECS-46 (Azure subscription prep) - Score: 9.5/10
- ‚úÖ Validated and approved ECS-18 (Terraform backend) - Score: 9/10
- ‚úÖ Updated all tracking documentation

### Current Status
- **Stories in Jira:** 28 (ECS-46, ECS-18 through ECS-44)
- **Stories Validated:** 2 of 28 ‚úÖ
- **Stories Remaining:** 26 (ECS-19 through ECS-44)
- **Total Story Points:** 143
- **Time Invested:** 80 minutes (60 min creation + 20 min validation)
- **Traditional Estimate:** 7.5-10 hours
- **Time Savings:** 82-87%

### Key Finding üö®
**Story validation caught a CRITICAL GAP**: Story 0 (Azure subscription preparation) was documented but never created in Jira. This demonstrates the exact value of the validation step - AI can generate excellent content but may miss "obvious" prerequisites that would cause confusion during sprint planning.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Next Session

### Immediate Action: Resume Story Validation

**Current Progress**: 2 of 28 stories validated ‚úÖ  
**Next Story**: ECS-19 (Terraform Networking Module)  
**Estimated Time Remaining**: 20-25 minutes

**Simple command to resume:**
```
Let's continue the story validation. Pull ECS-19 and review it.
```

### Validation Checklist (Use for Each Story)

1. ‚úÖ **Business Value**: Clear alignment with PRD requirements?
2. ‚úÖ **Acceptance Criteria**: Gherkin scenarios complete and testable?
3. ‚úÖ **Technical Feasibility**: Implementation details accurate?
4. ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Properly identified and sequenced?
5. ‚úÖ **Story Points**: Reasonable for the scope?
6. ‚úÖ **Definition of Done**: Complete and verifiable?
7. ‚úÖ **Roles/Personas**: Correct for the action?

### Stories Remaining to Review

**ECS-7 Infrastructure (9 stories):**
- ECS-19: Networking Module
- ECS-20: PostgreSQL Module
- ECS-21: Redis Module
- ECS-22: Kafka/Event Hub Module
- ECS-23: Key Vault Module
- ECS-24: Monitoring Module
- ECS-25: Docker Compose
- ECS-26: GitHub Actions
- ECS-27: Deploy Dev Environment
- ECS-28: Infrastructure Documentation

**ECS-8 User Service (16 stories):**
- ECS-29 through ECS-44

## üìã After Validation Complete (Next Actions)

### Option A: Tech Lead Phase (Recommended)
Create architecture diagrams for ECS-7 and ECS-8:
- Network topology
- System architecture
- Authentication flow sequences
- Database schemas

**Time**: 30-45 min with AI vs 2-3 hours traditional  
**Value**: Demonstrates Tech Lead role benefits

### Option B: More Story Breakdown
Break down next epic (ECS-10: Form Service):
- Shows repeatability
- Builds backlog depth

**Time**: 30-35 minutes

### Option C: Start Development
Implement ECS-46 or ECS-18:
- Shows developer role
- Creates actual infrastructure

**Time**: TBD (will measure)

| **Stories Validated** | 2 of 28 |
| **Total Story Points** | 143 |
| **Time Invested** | 80 minutes |

## üéì Key Learnings So Far

1. **AI + Human Review = Quality**
   - AI generates comprehensive stories in seconds
   - Human validation catches critical gaps (like missing ECS-46)
   - Review phase is NOT optional

2. **MCP Integration is Powerful**
   - Direct Jira creation/updates saves massive time
   - No context switching or manual data entry
   - Validation happens in-context

3. **Gap Detection is Critical**
   - Missing prerequisite stories can break sprint planning
   - Dependency validation prevents sequencing issues
   - Documentation cross-referencing finds omissions

4. **Interactive Process Works**
   - AI proposes, human validates, corrections applied
   - 5 minutes of validation prevented 30 minutes of rework
   - Collaboration is where the value is created
