# Architecture Update Summary
## Multi-Region, Multi-Instance Infrastructure Support

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Scope**: Infrastructure (ECS-7) Architecture Review and Update  
**Impact**: Major - Affects all infrastructure stories and deployment strategy

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

During story validation (ECS-19 review), we identified a **critical architectural gap**: the infrastructure was designed for single-environment deployment (dev, staging, prod) without support for:
- Multiple regions (West Europe, East US, etc.)
- Multiple instances per region/environment
- Independent deployments with isolated state

### What Changed

**Before**: Simple environment-based deployment
- ‚úó dev.tfvars ‚Üí single dev environment
- ‚úó prod.tfvars ‚Üí single prod environment  
- ‚úó Hard-coded CIDR ranges
- ‚úó Shared state file per environment

**After**: Multi-region, multi-instance deployment
- ‚úÖ `westeu-test-1`, `westeu-stg-1`, `westeu-prod-1`, `westeu-prod-2`
- ‚úÖ `eastus-prod-1`, `northeu-prod-1`
- ‚úÖ Pre-allocated CIDR ranges (prevents conflicts)
- ‚úÖ Isolated state file per deployment
- ‚úÖ Parallel deployment capability

## üéØ MVP Strategy

### Phase 1: Prove Single Deployment (Current Sprint)
**Goal**: Get `westeu-test-1` working end-to-end

1. ‚úÖ Deploy infrastructure for `westeu-test-1`
2. ‚úÖ Deploy all 8 microservices to `westeu-test-1`
3. ‚úÖ Validate end-to-end functionality
4. ‚úÖ Document deployment process

**Rationale**: Prove we can deploy once completely before building multiple environments.

### Phase 2: Expand Environments (Post-Sprint)
**Goal**: Replicate to staging and production

1. Deploy `westeu-stg-1` using same modules
2. Deploy `westeu-prod-1` using same modules
3. Validate each deployment independently

### Phase 3: Multi-Region (Future)
**Goal**: Geographic distribution

1. Deploy `eastus-prod-1` for US data residency
2. Enable VNet peering for cross-region communication
3. Implement cross-region DR

| Deployment | CIDR Block | Region | Purpose | Status |
|------------|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| `westeu-test-1` | 10.10.0.0/16 | West Europe | Primary dev/test | Active (MVP) |
| `westeu-stg-1` | 10.20.0.0/16 | West Europe | Staging/UAT | Reserved |
| `westeu-prod-1` | 10.30.0.0/16 | West Europe | Production (EU) | Reserved |

## üîß Terraform Changes Required

### New Variables (variables.tf)
```hcl
variable "region_code" {
  description = "Region code (westeu, eastus, etc.)"
  type        = string
}

variable "instance" {
  description = "Instance number within region+environment"
  type        = number
  default     = 1
}
```

### New Locals (locals.tf)
```hcl
locals {
  # CIDR allocation map
  cidr_allocations = {
    "westeu-test-1"  = "10.10.0.0/16"
    "westeu-stg-1"   = "10.20.0.0/16"
    "westeu-prod-1"  = "10.30.0.0/16"
    # ... full table
  }
  
  # Deployment identification
  deployment_name = "${var.region_code}-${var.environment}-${var.instance}"
  vnet_cidr = local.cidr_allocations[local.deployment_name]
  
  # Azure region mapping
  azure_region_map = {
    westeu  = "West Europe"
    eastus  = "East US"
    # ...
  }
  location = local.azure_region_map[var.region_code]
}
```

### New tfvars Structure
```
infrastructure/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deployments/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ westeu-test-1.tfvars
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ westeu-stg-1.tfvars
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ westeu-prod-1.tfvars
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ eastus-prod-1.tfvars
```

### New Deployment Script

#!/bin/bash
# scripts/deploy.sh
DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$1

terraform init -backend-config="key=${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}.tfstate"
terraform workspace select ${DEPLOYMENT_NAME} || terraform workspace new ${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
terraform plan -var-file="deployments/${DEPLOYMENT_NAME}.tfvars"

3. Create westeu-prod-1.tfvars and deploy production
4. Implement VNet peering between deployments
5. Enable cross-region DR

## üí° Key Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Workspace + tfvars (vs. Separate Directories)
**Chosen**: Terraform workspaces + deployment-specific tfvars  
**Rationale**:
- Single codebase for all deployments
- Easier module updates (update once, apply everywhere)
- Explicit deployment naming
- State isolation via backend keys

**Alternative Considered**: Separate directories per deployment  
**Rejected Because**: Code duplication, module version drift

### Decision 2: Pre-allocated CIDR Ranges
**Chosen**: Central CIDR allocation table in locals.tf  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents CIDR conflicts
- Enables future VNet peering
- Documents all deployments in one place
- Fails fast if deployment not in table

**Alternative Considered**: Dynamic CIDR calculation  
**Rejected Because**: Risk of conflicts, less transparent

### Decision 3: MVP Focus on Single Deployment
**Chosen**: Deliver `westeu-test-1` completely first  
**Rationale**:
- Prove architecture works end-to-end
- Faster time to value
- Identify issues early
- Easier to debug with single environment

**Alternative Considered**: Deploy all 3 layers simultaneously  
**Rejected Because**: Slower, riskier, harder to troubleshoot

## üìà Impact on Project

### Time Impact
- **Story Point Increase**: +5 points (68-73 total for Sprint 1)
- **Implementation Time**: Minimal increase (better architecture upfront)
- **Future Savings**: Significant (can deploy new regions in minutes)

### Risk Impact
- **New Risk**: CIDR allocation complexity
- **Mitigated By**: Pre-allocated table, validation in scenarios
- **Reduced Risk**: Multi-environment deployment (proven architecture)

### Value Impact
- **Scalability**: Can now deploy to any region/instance
- **Flexibility**: Blue/green deployments possible
- **Data Residency**: Can meet EU/US requirements
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-size each deployment independently

## üéì Lessons Learned (for Consulting Portfolio)

1. **Architecture validation is critical** - AI can miss deployment complexity
2. **Ask "what if" questions early** - Multi-region needs emerged during review
3. **Network planning is often underestimated** - CIDR allocation prevents pain
4. **MVP strategy reduces risk** - One complete deployment > three partial ones
5. **Documentation during design** - Infrastructure_Architecture.md prevents confusion
6. **Story points should reflect complexity** - Updated ECS-18 and ECS-19 appropriately
