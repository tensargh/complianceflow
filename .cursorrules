# ComplianceFlow Development Rules

## License Compliance - CRITICAL

### GPL Prohibition
- **NEVER** suggest, recommend, or use libraries licensed under:
  - GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 or v3
  - GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
  - GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)
  - Any other copyleft licenses that require derivative works to be open-sourced

### License Evaluation Process
Before recommending ANY third-party library or dependency:
1. **CHECK the license** - Look up the library's license explicitly
2. **VERIFY compatibility** - Ensure it's compatible with proprietary software
3. **DOCUMENT the license** - Note the license type when suggesting packages

### Acceptable Licenses (Non-Exhaustive List)
✅ MIT License
✅ Apache License 2.0
✅ BSD Licenses (2-Clause, 3-Clause)
✅ ISC License
✅ Python Software Foundation License
✅ Unlicense / Public Domain

### Questionable/Research Required
⚠️ Mozilla Public License (MPL) - File-level copyleft, evaluate carefully
⚠️ Eclipse Public License (EPL) - Weak copyleft, evaluate carefully
⚠️ Creative Commons licenses - Depends on variant

### Always Rejected
❌ GPL (any version)
❌ LGPL (any version)
❌ AGPL (any version)
❌ Any license requiring derivative works to be open-sourced

### When Suggesting Dependencies
When recommending a package, library, or framework:
- State: "Package X is licensed under [LICENSE]"
- If unsure: "I'll check the license for Package X"
- If GPL/copyleft: "Package X uses GPL/copyleft license - we need an alternative"

### Documentation Requirements
- Add license information to requirements.txt comments when relevant
- Document any license concerns in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Track all dependencies and their licenses

## Code Ownership
- All code in this repository is proprietary
- Copyright holder has exclusive rights
- Only the copyright holder may grant reuse permissions
