# ComplianceFlow Development Rules

## License Compliance - CRITICAL

### GPL Prohibition
- **NEVER** suggest, recommend, or use libraries licensed under:
  - GNU General Public License (GPL) v2 or v3
  - GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
  - GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)
  - Any other copyleft licenses that require derivative works to be open-sourced

### License Evaluation Process
Before recommending ANY third-party library or dependency:
1. **CHECK the license** - Look up the library's license explicitly
2. **VERIFY compatibility** - Ensure it's compatible with proprietary software
3. **DOCUMENT the license** - Note the license type when suggesting packages

### Acceptable Licenses (Non-Exhaustive List)
✅ MIT License
✅ Apache License 2.0
✅ BSD Licenses (2-Clause, 3-Clause)
✅ ISC License
✅ Python Software Foundation License
✅ Unlicense / Public Domain

### Questionable/Research Required
⚠️ Mozilla Public License (MPL) - File-level copyleft, evaluate carefully
⚠️ Eclipse Public License (EPL) - Weak copyleft, evaluate carefully
⚠️ Creative Commons licenses - Depends on variant

### Always Rejected
❌ GPL (any version)
❌ LGPL (any version)
❌ AGPL (any version)
❌ Any license requiring derivative works to be open-sourced

### When Suggesting Dependencies
When recommending a package, library, or framework:
- State: "Package X is licensed under [LICENSE]"
- If unsure: "I'll check the license for Package X"
- If GPL/copyleft: "Package X uses GPL/copyleft license - we need an alternative"

### Documentation Requirements
- Add license information to requirements.txt comments when relevant
- Document any license concerns in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Track all dependencies and their licenses

## Code Ownership
- All code in this repository is proprietary
- Copyright holder has exclusive rights
- Only the copyright holder may grant reuse permissions

## Reminder
This project is **proprietary software**. License compliance is not optional—it's mandatory to protect intellectual property rights.

## Documentation Discipline - CRITICAL

### Documentation Principles

**ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH:**
- **TASKLIST.md** = ONLY place for tasks, todos, next actions, checklists
- **Reference docs** = Definitions, specifications, reference only (NO tasks/todos/changelogs)
- **README files** = Navigation and quick start guides only

**When Creating New Documents:**
- Ask: Does this serve a unique, focused purpose?
- Check: Can this be added to an existing document instead?
- Ensure: Document has single, clear purpose
- Avoid: Task lists, action items, todo checklists in reference docs

**Document Types:**
- **Reference** - Roles_and_Personas.md, Tech_Stack_Definition.md (definitions only)
- **Requirements** - PRD files (specifications, no tasks)
- **Process** - Workflow documents (how-to, no specific tasks)
- **Tracking** - TASKLIST.md (tasks), Time_Savings_Log.md (metrics)
- **Business** - Business_Value_Proposition.md (sales pitch, evidence)

**Prohibited:**
- ❌ Task lists in multiple documents
- ❌ "Next Actions" sections in reference docs
- ❌ Duplicate information across files
- ❌ Mixing reference content with action items

## Business Value Documentation - CRITICAL

### Primary Project Goal
This project serves as a **consulting portfolio and demonstration vehicle** to showcase AI-assisted SDLC implementation expertise. The technical product is secondary to the business value demonstration.

### Automatic Documentation Updates
When completing ANY work in the SDLC (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment):

1. **ALWAYS update** `docs/Business_Value_Proposition.md`:
   - Add time savings observed for the specific role/stage
   - Update the elevator pitch productivity tally
   - Add concrete examples of AI assistance benefits
   - Keep evidence-based, realistic claims

2. **ALWAYS update** `docs/Time_Savings_Log.md`:
   - Record the task/epic/story worked on
   - Estimate traditional time (without AI assistance)
   - Record actual time spent (with AI assistance)
   - Calculate and log the time savings percentage
   - Note techniques that provided the most value

3. **Focus on demonstrable value**:
   - How much faster was the work completed?
   - What tedious work was automated (boilerplate, formatting, etc.)?
   - What quality improvements were achieved (consistency, completeness)?
   - What would a traditional approach have missed?

### Consulting Value Proposition
Emphasize throughout documentation:
- Techniques are **tool-agnostic** (can apply to C#/Azure/ADO, Java/AWS, etc.)
- Consultant provides **full SDLC expertise**, not just coding
- Time savings compound across all roles (PO, Dev, QA, DevOps)
- Measurable ROI through tracked productivity improvements
- Emphasis on interactive, validated approach (AI assists, humans verify)

### Documentation Style
- Business value docs should be **sales-oriented** (benefits, ROI, time savings)
- Technical docs should be **implementation-oriented** (how-to, examples)
- Keep them separate but cross-referenced
- Business value docs are for leadership/decision-makers
- Technical docs are for practitioners

### Success Metrics
Track and document:
- Time to complete each SDLC phase
- Story points delivered per sprint
- Quality metrics (test coverage, bug rates)
- Developer satisfaction and velocity
- Comparison to industry benchmarks

## Jira Synchronization - CRITICAL

### Keep Jira as Source of Truth for Active Work

**MANDATORY RULE:** Whenever you modify, review, or enhance a Jira story in documentation, you **MUST** immediately update the actual Jira story using the Atlassian MCP.

### Synchronization Workflow

**ALWAYS follow this sequence:**

1. **Review/Update Documentation**
   - Make changes to story files (e.g., `docs/prds/ECS-7_Infrastructure_Stories.md`)
   - Update review documents (e.g., `docs/reviews/Story_Evaluations_ECS-18-44.md`)
   
2. **IMMEDIATELY Update Jira** (DO NOT SKIP THIS)
   - Use `mcp_atlassian-official_editJiraIssue` to update the story
   - Include ALL changes: description, acceptance criteria, DoD, technical notes
   - Ensure formatting is Jira-compatible (Markdown)
   
3. **Add Tracking Comment**
   - Use `mcp_atlassian-official_addCommentToJiraIssue` to document the update
   - Note what changed, why, and when
   - Reference review documents if applicable

4. **Update TASKLIST.md**
   - Mark story as "✅ JIRA STORY UPDATED"
   - Track synchronization completion

### What Must Be Synchronized

**ALWAYS update Jira when you:**
- ✅ Add new acceptance criteria scenarios
- ✅ Enhance Definition of Done items
- ✅ Update technical implementation notes
- ✅ Modify story points or priorities
- ✅ Add security/performance requirements
- ✅ Change dependencies
- ✅ Add multi-deployment architecture details
- ✅ Incorporate review feedback
- ✅ Fix inconsistencies or gaps

### Why This Matters

**Jira is what developers see and work from.**
- Documentation files are reference/archive
- Jira stories are the active working artifacts
- Desynchronization causes confusion and rework
- Developers need the latest, most accurate information

### Atlassian MCP Usage

**Update Story:**
```
mcp_atlassian-official_editJiraIssue
- cloudId: https://timensor.atlassian.net
- issueIdOrKey: ECS-XX
- fields: { "description": "..." }
```

**Add Comment:**
```
mcp_atlassian-official_addCommentToJiraIssue
- cloudId: https://timensor.atlassian.net
- issueIdOrKey: ECS-XX
- commentBody: "**Story Enhanced - [Date]**\n\n[Details]"
```

### Red Flags - When Synchronization Is Missing

**STOP and synchronize if you:**
- ❌ Complete a story review without updating Jira
- ❌ Add new scenarios to documentation but not Jira
- ❌ Enhance DoD in docs but not Jira
- ❌ Note "Update Jira later" (NO - update NOW)
- ❌ Batch updates for "efficiency" (NO - sync immediately per story)

### Exception

**ONLY skip Jira sync if:**
- Story doesn't exist yet in Jira (create it first)
- Changes are to non-story documents (architecture docs, guides, etc.)
- Working on future epics not yet in Jira

### Reminder

**"If you touched a story document, you MUST touch the Jira story."**

This is not optional. This is not a "nice to have." This is mandatory workflow discipline to maintain team velocity and prevent confusion.
